# Analysis Top Movies

This is just a personal project to analyse the data from the top ranked movies. 
Beforehand I tried to think just of a few questions and then see if I could find an answer for them.

Originaly I thought just to analyse the data of the IMDB website. But after doing this thought to expand to other websites. 

# list of interesting website list to scrape for information:
1. https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/
1. https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/
1. https://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/score/metascore/all/filtered?sort=desc
1. https://www.moviemeter.nl/toplijst/film/1/top-250-beste-films-aller-tijden

## Interesting questions to see for each site separately
1. With x==years and y==rating ->is there an increase in the quality of films over time? ( )
1. Does the runtime affect the rating?=> do longer movies have higher scores? (more exposition vs to long) ( )
1. Is there a cutoff in time => is there a length at which scores go down ( )
1. Which genres are the most in the top 250 of cases  ( )
1. Which genre has highest average score => drama action or crime ( )
1. Is there a change in movie genre over time ->to be seen how best to find this out (maybe for each decade?)
1. Does a director come up multiple times => if so who are most prominent? ( )
1. which languages are most spoken in the movies in top 250 =>would expect english to make 75% ( )
1. From which "country" do most of the cases come from? => would think most from USA??
1. Average Rating for the different countries? 
1. Which actor played in most of the movies in the list?

1. See if can get info on the writers! ->are there writers involved with multiple of the movies.
1. Box office??? =>what is biggest grocing film on list (different from ranking?)

## Interesting questions for comparing the movies in different websites
1. Are there movies that are in all the lists
1. Is there a difference in genres (maybe a website attracts specific interested parties) 
1. which website's numbers are based on the most reviews 
1. Is the #reviews/year the same in all webpages? (again related to which users it could attract)
